# Notechondria

This is the last app I developed in django fullstack, this is the first, and the last complete project that I will commit to and maintain for the rest of my life.

Notechondria names from the Note and Mitocondria, we wish the note could be the power that forster personal accomplishments rather than text or drawing on ipad or other medias. We wish to connect all the data togther to create an easy accessible database for each individual in the age of information.

Some of the key features of the app includes:

* Use generative AI to connect notes together with auto tagging.
* Use generative AI to parse the note to others.
* Share the note seamlessly across devices and media, including images, datasets, latex, markdown and etc.
* Card-like note trunkation and auto generate the note for the day based on user output

We will not share any data or sell any data with others because the developer is the main user for the app.

We will not use your knowlege to feed the AI, we use openAI API and ensures that your origional ideas and thoughts will not be used for training.
