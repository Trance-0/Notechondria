# Notechondria

This is the last app I developed in Django full-stack, this is the first, and the last complete project that I will commit to and maintain for the rest of my life.

May your note be your power for success.

Notechondria names from the Note and Mitochondria, we wish the note could be the power that fosters personal accomplishments rather than text or drawing on iPad or other media. We wish to connect all the data to create an easily accessible database for each individual in the age of information.

Some of the key features of the app include:

* Use generative AI to connect notes with auto-tagging.
* Use generative AI to parse the note to others.
* Share the note seamlessly across devices and media, including images, datasets, latex, markdown, etc.
* Card-like note truncation and auto-generate the note for the day based on user output

We will not share or sell any data with others because the developer is the app's main user.

We will not use your knowledge to feed the AI, we use open API and ensure that your original ideas and thoughts will not be used for training.
